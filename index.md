Hi, I am Jaeyoun Yoo in Handong Global University. My major is biology and computer science. I am senior student and I am ready for graduation. Nice to meet you everybody. 

### Computer science

I am very interested in coding. I learned computer languages such as C, C++, Python, Java. I took subjects like Logic design, Operating systems, Data structures, Open souce sytem lab. I'm still not good at coding, but I'm proud to see myself getting better and better. It's also fun to think about algorithms. 

### Biology 

Also I love biology. I took many subjects in biology such as Molecular biology, Microbiology, Organic chemistry, Biochemistry, Physiology, Bioinformatics, Antibiotics, Applied genetics, etc. It was also interesting to experiment directly through practical subjects. I want to become biology data scientist from these major skills.
